#summary Issues encountered while testing out Frostwave

  * Not sure if we fixed LoadContent/UnloadContent problem
    * Definitely need comprehensive tests for 0.3, content system is inconsistent/unreliable
  * Using XML for every sprite is a bit of a hassle
  * Physics.CS is in F2D, should be game specific
  * See if we need MaxInputs
